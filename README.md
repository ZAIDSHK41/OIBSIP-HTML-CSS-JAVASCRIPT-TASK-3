ðŸŒŸ OIBSIP TASK 3 ðŸŒŸ 
The user will input a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and press a "convert" button. The converted temperature will then be displayed with the correct unit. Your UI should include four main elements: Input field for the user to type in their temperature - don't forget to validate that the input is a number!. Dropdown menu or radio button for the user to choose if they are inputting in Celsius or Fahrenheit ."Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion. Display area for the final converted temperature and unit. For an extra challenge: You can add in a third conversion option to convert from and to Kelvin as well.

ðŸš€ Here are some bullet points summarizing the project:
ðŸ”¹ Ensure the input field provides real-time validation to prevent non-numeric entries.
ðŸ”¹ Clearly label the dropdown or radio buttons for easy selection between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
ðŸ”¹ Implement error handling for empty or invalid inputs, displaying a helpful message to the user.
ðŸ”¹ Use a visually distinct "Convert" button to make it clear when the conversion is triggered.
ðŸ”¹ Display the converted temperature in a readable format with the correct unit symbol (Â°C, Â°F, or K).
ðŸ”¹ Consider adding a reset or clear button to allow users to input a new value quickly.
ðŸ”¹ Add a brief explanation of the conversion formulas for educational purposes.
ðŸ”¹ Use CSS or styling to make the UI intuitive and visually appealing.
ðŸ”¹ Provide instant feedback or animations to indicate that the conversion has taken place.
